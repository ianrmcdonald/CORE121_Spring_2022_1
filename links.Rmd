Welcome to CORE121-09 and CORE121-13: Election Science.  

Here are some important links.  I am not planning to print hardcopies of the syllabus but if you want one let me know.

### Syllabus

html link: **https://bit.ly/3DsSIgk**  
pdf link: **https://bit.ly/2WyzYea**  

I recommend the html link.

### Google Classroom

The enrollment code is mds6pv2
The invitation link can be found at **https://classroom.google.com/c/NDUwMzYxODk3MTUw?cjc=mds6pv2**

Once you're enrolled, this code should get you to the class:
**https://classroom.google.com/u/0/c/NDUwMzYxODk3MTUw**

### Office 365 for Excel

Go to **https://products.office.com/en-us/student/office-in-education** and enroll with your LC account.

You should download and install Excel, and the Microsoft suite is a useful benefit provided by the college for free.  

### RStudio Cloud

Go to **https://rstudio.cloud/** and choose RStudio server.  Instructions for enrolling will be available on the classroom website.
